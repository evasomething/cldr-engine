# cldr-engine

Internationalization in Typescript with Unicode CLDR, with batteries included

## Goals

* Support a broad set of CLDR features in the browser "out of the box".
* Resolve the CLDR "data explosion problem".
* Support all scripts and regions for a given language in a single compact resource pack.
* No additional library dependencies are required.
* No custom extraction of CLDR data or precompilation of formatters is required.
* Work across browsers and Javascript runtime environments.
* Provide type-safe access to resource packs, reducing potential errors.
* No familiarity with CLDR structure is required for developers to use this library.

TODO: design document spelling out why these are useful goals and how they are accomplished.
