## Project

Visit [the Github project page](https://github.com/phensley/cldr-engine) for details.

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://phensley.github.io/cldr-engine/) is mostly complete but under development in advance of a 1.0 release.

## Demonstration

 * [CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/qqr1rl40r6) can be used to experiment, report bugs, etc.
 * [Demonstration app](https://phensley.github.io/cldr-engine-react-demo/) provides an example using React and Redux. ([source code](https://github.com/phensley/cldr-engine-react-demo))

## Goals

* Support a broad set of CLDR features in the browser "out of the box".
* Resolve the CLDR "data explosion" problem.
* Support all scripts and regions for a given language in a single compact resource pack.
* No additional library dependencies required.
* No custom extraction of CLDR data or precompilation of formatters required.
* Correctness and consistency across browsers and Javascript runtime environments.
* Provide type-safety, reducing programming errors.
* No familiarity with CLDR structure is required for developers to use this library.
* High performance.
* Enhance functionality with arbitrary precision decimal math.
